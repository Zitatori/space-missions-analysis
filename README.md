# ðŸš€ Space Missions Analysis (1957â€“2020)

This project analyses the history of space missions using the dataset from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com).  
It covers exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and a wide variety of visualisations to uncover trends in space exploration.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Includes every recorded space mission since 1957  
- **Tech stack:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **Goals:**  
  - Explore mission costs over time  
  - Compare mission success vs failures  
  - Identify dominant countries and organisations  
  - Visualise the Cold War space race (USA vs USSR)  
  - Analyse the rise of modern players like SpaceX

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights

- The **Soviet Union** led the number of launches during most of the Cold War,  
  while the **USA** focused on fewer but more high-profile missions (e.g., Apollo).  
- **Failure rates** were extremely high (~70%) in the 1950sâ€“60s, but dropped dramatically after the 1980s.  
- **SpaceX** has revolutionised launch economics since the 2010s, reducing costs per launch significantly.  
- Seasonal patterns exist: some months show consistently more launches than others.
